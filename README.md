🕌 U Think U Know Islam? – Python Quiz Game
📖 Introduction

"U Think U Know Islam" is a Python-based console quiz game designed to test and improve your knowledge about Islam and the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to combine education and fun. The program asks multiple-choice questions, validates answers, and allows users to exit or continue at any time.

✨ Features

✅ 15 multiple-choice questions (ordered from easy to hard)

✅ Clean modular code (separate files for questions, logic, and entry point)

✅ Exit anytime (exit or quit) with confirmation

✅ Feedback on right/wrong answers

✅ Extendable: add more questions easily

📌 Future Improvements

🎨 Add color output for right/wrong answers (using colorama)

🎲 Randomize question order for replay value

🖥️ Build a GUI version (Tkinter or PyQt)

🙌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how basic Python concepts like classes, loops, and conditionals can be combined into an interactive program.

It’s a fun way to learn Python, test your knowledge about Islam, and even share with friends.
